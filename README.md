# Bidzone auction website (Semester Project 2)

<img src="/assets/images/Bidzone-screenshot.jpg" width="500">

This is my second-semester project at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, which took 5 weeks to complete. My main goal was to use what I've learned in the past three semesters to build an auction website.

## Description
Bidzone is an online auction platform. To use all its features, you need to log in or create an account. Unregistered users can browse items and see item details. Registered users can access their profiles, check earned credits, view created listings, edit their info, and create new listings. 
New users are initially provided with 1000 credits. Users can accumulate more credits by receiving bids on their own listings, while they expend credits when placing bids on listings from other users. Registration requires using your @stud.noroff email address.



## User Stories:

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
- A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- A registered user may add a Bid to another user’s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- A registered user may use credit to make a Bid on another user’s Listing
- An unregistered user may search through Listings
